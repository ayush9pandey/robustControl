function [f,g] = cola_lv_lin(X,u)
%
% cola_lv_lin - This function designed for use with 'cola_lin.m' to
%        create a linear model of a LV-distillation column.
%
%     x - states (liquid composition and liquid hold up)
%     u - inputs and disturbances (reflux, boilup, feedrate and feed
%         composition)
%     g - outputs (distillate and bottoms compostition)
%
%  NOTE: Everything here is row vectors rather than columnn vectors
