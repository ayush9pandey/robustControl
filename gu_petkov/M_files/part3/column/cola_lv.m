% cola_lv - Subroutine for simulation with LV-configuration.
%           It calls the model colamod, and 
%           includes control of condenser and reboiler level 
%           using two P-controllers with the LV-configuration. 
%
%           Inputs are reflux (LT) and boilup (VB). Disturbances
%           are feedrate and feed composition. These are set by directly
%           altering 'cola_lv.m'. Outputs are liquid composition and
%           liquid hold up for stages 1 through NT, given in x.
