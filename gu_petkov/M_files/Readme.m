% This collection of M-files contains files accompanying the second edition
% of the book “Robust Control Design with MATLAB” by Da-Wei Gu, Petko H. 
% Petkov and Mihail M. Konstantinov, Springer-Verlag, London, 2012
% intended for use with Robust Control Toolbox, version 3.
%
% The collection contains the following folders:
%
% part2
%
%   /chapter9   Example M-files to build and analyze LTI and uncertain 
%               models.
%
%   /chapter10  Example M-files to analyze robust stability and robust 
%               performance of uncertain systems.
%
%   /chapter11  Example M-files for Hinf design.
%
%   /chapter12  Example M-files for mu-synthesis.
%
%   /chapter13  Example M-files for analysis and design of 
%               parameter-dependent systems.
%
% part3
%
%   /hdd       	M-files to design and analyse robust servo system
%               of Hard Disk Drive. 
%
%   /pendul    	M-files to design and analyse robust control system
%               for stabilization of Triple Inverted Pendulum.
%
%   /column     M-files to design and analyse robust control system
%               of high purity Distillation Column.
%
%   /flexman    M-files to design and analyse robust control system
%               of Flexible-Link Manipulator.
%
%   /tras       M-files to design and analyse Twin-Rotor Aerodynamic
%               System.
%
%   /robot      M-files to design and analyse Self-Balancing Two-Wheeled
%               Robot.
%
% In part3, there is a file with name contents.m in each folder, containing 
% a list of files with description of their purpose. Before use the files 
% it is desirable to copy the corresponding folder to your hard disk. 
% The M-files may be used with the program system MATLAB, version R2011a 
% or latter. It is necessary to have the Robust Control Toolbox, version 3, 
% Control System Toolbox, version 9.1 and Simulink, version 7.7.
